# What is Loop?

Well, it's kind of like my blog I guess, except anyone is welcome to add,
(not that anyone will). 
It's meant to serve as a catalog of common `for-loop` patterns over anything 
from 1D arrays to $n$D arrays. For example, in image processing we often run into common 
cases where we may want to iterate over a 2D image and apply a convolution. Although there 
are numerous packages that do exactly this, it's still nice to see what's 
actually happening. 
Similarly, we may want to write a 2D image into a 1D array, or vice versa.


## Structure

solution written in pseudo code or Python and an explantion.

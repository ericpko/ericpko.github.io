# A Weathery Journey

This is a 3D puzzle-platformer where you play as a wizard that has the
power to manipulate the weather around him. You use his abilities&mdash;sun,
wind, rain, and snow&mdash;to solve puzzles and platform your way across
the levels! This was a really fun project where I had the pleasure of
working with a small team of developers, artists, and musicians from the 
*University of Toronto*, and *OCAD University*.

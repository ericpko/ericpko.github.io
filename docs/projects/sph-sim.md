# 2D Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics

This was a fun final project that I chose for my physics-based
animation course at UofT. Check out my SIGGRAPH Technical Brief
[here](../assets/SPH-sim.pdf){ target="_blank" } 
where you can find the in-depth details from this project.
Below I've provided a simulation demo of the results written 
in MATLAB.

I've recently re-implmented
[this project](https://github.com/ericpko/sph-fluid-simulation){ target="_blank" } 
in Rust using the
[ggez](https://ggez.rs/){ target="_blank" } game library.

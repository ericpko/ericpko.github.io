# 2D Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics

This was a fun final project that I chose for my physics-based
animation course at UofT. Check out my SIGGRAPH Technical Brief
[here](../assets/SPH-sim.pdf){ target="_blank" } 
where you can find the in-depth details from this project.
Below I've provided a simulation demo of the results written 
in MATLAB.

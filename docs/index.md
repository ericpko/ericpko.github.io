&emsp;I recently graduated from the *University of Toronto* St. George
(downtown) campus with an HBSc in **Computer Science**. My favorite
topics in CS include **computer graphics**, game design, and operating
systems. Throughout my studies I have acquired great problem solving
skills and have gained experience with a variety of programming
languages and software tools. Currently, my language of choice is
the **Rust** programming language. The more I learn about Rust, the
more I love this language; it's absolutely brilliant!

On a personal level, I'm a well-rounded individual who enjoys playing racket
sports such as tennis, badminton, pickleball, and table tennis. I also
enjoy paddleboarding, working out, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
